# quandale

This is just a silly project I made so I can learn how to write a README.md and how to use github in VS Code the program itself isn't really *that* good

Hopefully this is readable :smiley_cat:

# HOW TO RUN THIS

>[!NOTE]
>I built this using [Love2D](https://www.love2d.org/) so you **will** have to install that through *their instructions*.

## LINUX

CD into the directory you put the *quandale folder* in using the *terminal*

**example:**
```
cd ~/Downloads
```

>[!WARNING]
>DO NOT CD INSIDE THE **QUANDALE FOLDER** BECAUSE IT WON'T *WORK*

**And write:**
```
love quandale
```

or you can just open the *release* using [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/)

## Windows

Open the folder using [Love2D](https://www.love2d.org/)

>[!NOTE]
>+ You can open the folder through a shortcut of the love.exe file or just drag the folder into the love.exe
>+ or you can just open the exe file on the *release* tab
