# quandale

this is just a silly project I made so I can learn how to write a README.md the program itself isn't really *that* good

# HOW TO RUN THIS

>[!NOTE]
>I built this using [Love2D](https://www.love2d.org/) so you **will** have to install that through *their* instructions.

## LINUX

cd into the directory you put the folder in

>[!WARNING]
>DO NOT CD INSIDE THE FOLDER BECAUSE IT WON'T WORK

and write:
'''
love quandale
'''

or you can just open the release using [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/)

## Windows

Open the folder using love2D

>[!NOTE]
>You can open the folder through a shortcut of the love.exe file or just drag the folder into the love.exe

or you can just open the exe file on the release tab
